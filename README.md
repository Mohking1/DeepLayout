Interior Plan Generation for Residential Buildings

1. Configuration
  Python 
  PyTorch 
  Visual Studio 
  Qt 
2. Creating the dataset
(1) Download the dataset;
(2) Create a directory named `dataset` under the root directory, and divide the dataset into
`dataset/train` and `dataset/val`;
(3) Run `python write_pickle.py`, and this should create a new directory, `pickle`, under the root
directory.
3. Training the models
We provide four training scripts: `train_living.py`, `train_continue.py`, `train_location.py`
and`train_wall.py` that you can find in the folder `Living`, `Continue`, `Location`, and `Wall`,
respectively. The neural networks are described in detail in our paper.
4. Synth floor plans
1) Move the trained models into the folder `synth/trained_model`;
These trained models includes:
living_fc1_300.pth, living_resnet34_300.pth
continue_fc2_300.pth, continue_resnet34_300.pth
location_up1_100.pth, location_resnet34_100.pth
wall_up1_100.pth, wall_resnet34_100.pth
2) Now, navigate to `/synth`, and run `python synth.py`. The output floor plan is in the folder
`synth_output`.
5. Vectorization
To vectorize the floor plans generated by our method, run `python vectorization.py`. This should
create a new directory, ` synth_vectorization`, under the root directory.
There is also a GUI tool to visualize the vectorized floor plans.
